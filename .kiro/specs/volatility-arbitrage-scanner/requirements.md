# ANFA Volatility Arbitrage Scanner Requirements

## Introduction

The Volatility Arbitrage Scanner is an empirical edge detection engine designed to identify money-printing opportunities through pure data-driven analysis. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on theoretical models like Black-Scholes, this system learns patterns directly from market data, following the proven methodology of high-performing systems like the Oxford LSTM (1.329 Sharpe ratio) that completely bypass option pricing theory.

The scanner implements the core volatility arbitrage component of the 5-Element Money-Printing Framework, focusing on finding REAL mispricings based on actual market behavior rather than theoretical expectations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to harvest complete options flow data in real-time, so that I can detect smart money movements and unusual activity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning options chains THEN the system SHALL pull complete bid/ask/mid/volume data for all strikes and expirations
2. WHEN unusual activity occurs THEN the system SHALL detect volume spikes above historical norms
3. WHEN open interest changes THEN the system SHALL track and flag significant shifts
4. WHEN processing data THEN the system SHALL use NO Black-Scholes calculations - only raw market data
5. WHEN data is collected THEN the system SHALL store tick-by-tick options flow for pattern analysis

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a trader, I want empirical volatility calculations based on actual market moves, so that I can avoid theoretical model assumptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating volatility THEN the system SHALL use ACTUAL realized move distributions, not implied volatility
2. WHEN measuring historical volatility THEN the system SHALL implement Parkinson, Garman-Klass, and Yang-Zhang methods
3. WHEN ranking volatility THEN the system SHALL build percentile rankings from ACTUAL move history
4. WHEN detecting regime changes THEN the system SHALL track volatility shifts empirically without model assumptions
5. WHEN comparing periods THEN the system SHALL analyze 10d, 20d, 30d, and 60d realized volatility windows

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a trader, I want pattern recognition that learns from market data like successful LSTM models, so that I can identify pre-explosion setups.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing patterns THEN the system SHALL learn directly from price/volume/options data without theoretical assumptions
2. WHEN matching setups THEN the system SHALL identify current patterns that match historical pre-explosion configurations
3. WHEN scoring opportunities THEN the system SHALL base scores on historical win rates, not Greeks or theoretical values
4. WHEN validating patterns THEN the system SHALL measure actual outcomes vs predicted moves
5. WHEN learning THEN the system SHALL continuously update pattern recognition based on new market data

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a trader, I want comprehensive catalyst event mapping, so that I can time entries around binary events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN detecting events THEN the system SHALL identify binary catalysts (earnings, Fed announcements, product launches)
2. WHEN analyzing history THEN the system SHALL measure actual move distributions for each catalyst type
3. WHEN tracking AI companies THEN the system SHALL monitor AI revenue growth and infrastructure spending
4. WHEN processing news THEN the system SHALL detect sentiment velocity changes and momentum shifts
5. WHEN timing entries THEN the system SHALL provide optimal entry windows relative to catalyst timing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a trader, I want market microstructure analysis that reveals institutional positioning, so that I can follow smart money.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing flow THEN the system SHALL detect options flow imbalances indicating directional bias
2. WHEN measuring dealer exposure THEN the system SHALL calculate gamma exposure levels and pin risk zones
3. WHEN identifying support/resistance THEN the system SHALL use volume profile analysis, not technical indicators
4. WHEN tracking positioning THEN the system SHALL monitor dealer hedging requirements and flow impacts
5. WHEN validating signals THEN the system SHALL confirm with multiple microstructure indicators

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a trader, I want multi-timeframe arbitrage scanning, so that I can find temporal mispricings across option cycles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comparing timeframes THEN the system SHALL analyze weekly vs monthly vs quarterly option pricing
2. WHEN detecting mispricings THEN the system SHALL identify temporal arbitrage opportunities
3. WHEN evaluating spreads THEN the system SHALL find optimal calendar spread configurations
4. WHEN monitoring structure THEN the system SHALL track term structure anomalies and mean reversion opportunities
5. WHEN ranking opportunities THEN the system SHALL prioritize based on risk-adjusted expected returns

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a trader, I want liquidity and flow validation, so that I can ensure tradeable opportunities with sufficient volume.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validating liquidity THEN the system SHALL ensure sufficient volume for position entry and exit
2. WHEN detecting institutional flow THEN the system SHALL identify block trades and sweep orders
3. WHEN monitoring ratios THEN the system SHALL track put/call ratios and skew changes
4. WHEN classifying flow THEN the system SHALL distinguish between institutional and retail order flow
5. WHEN assessing tradability THEN the system SHALL validate bid-ask spreads and market depth

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a trader, I want empirical market regime classification, so that I can adjust expectations based on current market state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN classifying regimes THEN the system SHALL empirically identify trending, choppy, and squeeze conditions
2. WHEN adjusting expectations THEN the system SHALL modify volatility forecasts based on VIX regime
3. WHEN monitoring correlations THEN the system SHALL track correlation breakdowns and regime shifts
4. WHEN detecting rotation THEN the system SHALL identify sector rotation patterns and momentum shifts
5. WHEN adapting strategies THEN the system SHALL adjust parameters based on current regime classification

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a trader, I want real-time opportunity ranking across hundreds of stocks, so that I can focus on the highest conviction setups.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning markets THEN the system SHALL process 500+ liquid stocks for arbitrage opportunities
2. WHEN scoring conviction THEN the system SHALL assign conviction levels (1-3) based on multiple factors
3. WHEN ranking opportunities THEN the system SHALL sort by expected move vs implied move differential
4. WHEN optimizing risk THEN the system SHALL apply Kelly criterion for position sizing recommendations
5. WHEN alerting THEN the system SHALL trigger notifications when high-conviction thresholds are met

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a trader, I want backtesting without theoretical models, so that I can validate strategies using actual historical outcomes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backtesting strategies THEN the system SHALL use ACTUAL historical moves, not theoretical pricing
2. WHEN measuring performance THEN the system SHALL calculate win rates, average returns, and maximum drawdowns
3. WHEN validating patterns THEN the system SHALL test across different market regimes and time periods
4. WHEN optimizing parameters THEN the system SHALL learn optimal settings empirically from historical data
5. WHEN reporting results THEN the system SHALL provide detailed performance attribution and risk metrics

## Performance Targets

- Process 500+ stocks in under 2 minutes
- Identify 3-5 high-conviction setups per week
- Target 60%+ win rate on Level 3 conviction signals
- Average return 150-300% on winning trades
- Maximum drawdown under 15% on systematic approach

## Output Format

Each scanner module produces structured JSON endpoints:

```json
{
  "symbol": "AAPL",
  "conviction_score": 2.8,
  "expected_move": 12.3,
  "implied_move": 7.1,
  "edge_percentage": 73.2,
  "catalyst": "earnings",
  "entry_signal": true,
  "position_size": 0.25,
  "risk_metrics": {
    "max_loss": 0.05,
    "win_probability": 0.68,
    "expected_return": 2.1
  }
}
```

## Key Differentiators

- NO theoretical pricing models - pure empirical learning
- Pattern recognition over mathematical models
- Flow-based rather than value-based analysis
- Learns from actual outcomes, not theoretical expectations
- Focuses on finding REAL mispricings in market behavior
