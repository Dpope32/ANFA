## Introduction

The Stock Price Prediction Algorithm is a hybrid quantitative-qualitative model designed to predict stock prices for any publicly traded security. The system combines polynomial regression analysis with P/E ratio data and qualitative market factors to generate three prediction scenarios: conservative (highest probability outcome), bullish (best case), and bearish (worst case). The goal is to build capital extremely fast through futures trading by providing highly accurate predictions. The system uses major tech stocks (TSLA, AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL, NVDA, AMD, TSM) as the initial training set but extends to any stock symbol.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to input a stock symbol and get price predictions, so that I can make profitable trades.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a stock symbol is entered THEN the system SHALL fetch historical data and generate predictions
2. WHEN predictions are complete THEN the system SHALL output conservative, bullish, and bearish price targets
3. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL show accuracy metrics (RÂ², RMSE)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the system to use multiple data sources, so that predictions are more accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sufficient data exists THEN the system SHALL use multivariate models (price + P/E + volume)
2. WHEN data is insufficient THEN the system SHALL fall back to simpler models
3. WHEN invalid data is detected THEN the system SHALL filter it out automatically

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a trader, I want insider trading data factored into predictions, so that I can capture edge from political trades.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN politician trades exist THEN the system SHALL adjust predictions accordingly
2. WHEN unusual activity is detected THEN the system SHALL factor this into scenarios

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a trader, I want automatic data fetching, so that I don't need to input data manually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a stock symbol is entered THEN the system SHALL fetch all required data automatically
2. WHEN primary data source fails THEN the system SHALL use backup sources
3. WHEN data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL show clear error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to see model performance visually, so that I can trust the predictions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN predictions are generated THEN the system SHALL show charts with historical data and predictions
2. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL show accuracy metrics and confidence levels

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to analyze one stock at a time, so that I can focus on high-accuracy predictions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the system THEN it SHALL process one stock per session
2. WHEN analysis completes THEN the system SHALL show conservative, bullish, and bearish scenarios

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want continuous model improvement, so that predictions get more accurate over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new market data becomes available THEN the system SHALL automatically retrain models
2. WHEN model performance degrades THEN the system SHALL trigger retraining pipelines
3. WHEN predictions are made THEN the system SHALL log actual vs predicted outcomes for learning
4. WHEN sufficient new data exists THEN the system SHALL evaluate neural network models against polynomial regression
5. WHEN deploying model updates THEN the system SHALL use A/B testing to validate improvements
