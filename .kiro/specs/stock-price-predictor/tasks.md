# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Set up core project structure

  - Create TypeScript project with basic directory structure
  - Define core interfaces: StockData, PredictionResult, AccuracyMetrics
  - Set up environment configuration for API keys
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 4.1_

- [x] 2. Implement multi-source data service

  - Create PolygonClient class for market data (prices, volume, OHLC, VWAP)
  - Create FinnhubClient class for fundamentals (P/E, earnings, financial metrics)
  - Create SecApiClient class for congressional trades and insider activity
  - Add data validation and error handling per source
  - Implement Redis caching with source-specific TTL
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [x] 3. Build polynomial regression prediction engine

  - Implement PolynomialRegression class with fit/predict methods
  - Add multivariate support for P/E ratio and volume when available
  - Create fallback to simple price-only model when data insufficient
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 2.2_

- [x] 4. Create three-scenario prediction generator

  - Implement ScenarioGenerator for conservative/bullish/bearish predictions
  - Calculate confidence intervals and probability scores

  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 6.2_

- [ ] 5. Add political trading and insider activity integration

  - Integrate SEC API congressional trades with party/chamber analysis
  - Add insider activity tracking with Form 4 filing analysis

  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_

- [ ] 6. Build visualization components

  - Create ChartGenerator for historical data + prediction charts
  - Display accuracy metrics and confidence levels
  - Show all three scenarios with probability indicators
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2_

- [x] 7. Create REST API and integrate components

  - Implement Express.js server with single prediction endpoint
  - Wire together data service, prediction engine, and visualization
  - Add error handling and response formatting
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 4.3, 6.1_

- [x] 9. Add Docker integration

  - Create Dockerfile for production deployment
  - Add docker-compose.yml with Redis service

  - Add Nginx reverse proxy configuration
  - Include health checks and proper networking
  - _Requirements: Deployment, Containerization_

- [ ] 8. Add basic continuous learning
  - Implement simple model performance logging
  - Create basic retraining trigger based on accuracy degradation
  - Add model versioning for A/B testing capability
  - _Requirements: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3_
