# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a simple, responsive frontend interface using SvelteKit and TypeScript that connects to the existing stock prediction API. The interface will provide users with an intuitive way to request stock predictions and view results in real-time, with WebSocket support for streaming updates and a clean, minimal design that loads quickly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to input a stock symbol and select an options expiration date, so that I can request predictions for specific stocks and timeframes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user loads the application THEN the system SHALL display an input field for stock symbol entry
2. WHEN the user interacts with the stock symbol field THEN the system SHALL accept alphanumeric input and convert to uppercase
3. WHEN the user needs to select an expiration date THEN the system SHALL provide a date picker component
4. WHEN the user clicks the GO button THEN the system SHALL validate inputs before making API requests
5. IF the stock symbol is empty THEN the system SHALL display a validation error message
6. IF the selected date is in the past THEN the system SHALL display a validation error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see prediction results displayed in a clean, readable format, so that I can quickly understand the stock analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API returns prediction data THEN the system SHALL display results in a structured format
2. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL show key metrics like predicted price, confidence level, and volatility
3. WHEN results are loading THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator
4. IF the API returns an error THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message
5. WHEN new predictions are available THEN the system SHALL update the display without requiring a page refresh

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want real-time updates during prediction processing, so that I can see progress and know the system is working.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a prediction request is initiated THEN the system SHALL establish a WebSocket connection for progress updates
2. WHEN progress updates are received THEN the system SHALL display current processing status
3. WHEN the WebSocket connection fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to polling the API
4. WHEN predictions are complete THEN the system SHALL close the WebSocket connection
5. IF the connection is lost THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect automatically

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load quickly and work smoothly, so that I can get predictions without delays or performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user first visits the application THEN the system SHALL load the initial page in under 2 seconds
2. WHEN the application builds THEN the system SHALL generate a minimal bundle size
3. WHEN the user navigates THEN the system SHALL use server-side rendering for initial load speed
4. WHEN JavaScript is disabled THEN the system SHALL still display the basic interface structure
5. WHEN the user submits requests THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback and responsiveness

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the frontend to integrate seamlessly with the existing API, so that I can leverage current backend functionality without modifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL use the existing /api/predict endpoint
2. WHEN sending requests THEN the system SHALL format data according to the current API specification
3. WHEN receiving responses THEN the system SHALL handle the existing API response format
4. IF the API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
5. WHEN the API structure changes THEN the system SHALL be easily adaptable through configuration

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the interface to work well on different devices and screen sizes, so that I can access predictions from desktop or mobile.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL display a responsive layout
2. WHEN the screen size changes THEN the system SHALL adapt the interface accordingly
3. WHEN using touch devices THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate touch targets
4. WHEN viewing on different browsers THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent functionality
5. WHEN accessibility tools are used THEN the system SHALL provide proper semantic markup and ARIA labels
